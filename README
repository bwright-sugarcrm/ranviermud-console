This is a Web-based console for a Ranvier MUD.  Ranvier MUD was created by Shawn Biddle (shawncplus@gmail.com) and is a very easy to create MUD.... if you know JavaScript.

This project was designed to take a lot of the guesswork out of creating a MUD.  This includes a Area/Map Editor, Character Editor, Mob Creator, and even a full fledged Item creator.  These can be very simple to create, and yet has all of the functionality that fully utilizing the Javascript code can let you have.
